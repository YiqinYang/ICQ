# ICQ (Single Agent)

This is a pytorch implementation of IAC on [Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning (D4RL)](https://github.com/rail-berkeley/d4rl), the corresponding paper of ICQ is [Believe What You See: Implicit Constraint Approach
for Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03400).

## Requirements

- python=3.6.5
- [Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning (D4RL)](https://github.com/rail-berkeley/d4rl)
- torch=1.1.0

## Quick Start

```shell
$ python3 run_agent.py
```

## Note
+ Since the multi-agent version of ICQ requires the specific datasets in SMAC, we will publish the complete codes later.
  
+ Enjoy Offline Reinforcement Learning :)
